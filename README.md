# Golf Predictive Analytics using Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to the readme file for the Golf Predictive Analytics study. Here you will find all information related to the project, including the business case, testing details, and instructions for deployment.

## Business Case

A golf coaching company has approached us to conduct a study to help them analyse the foci of their coaching techniques with prospective elite-level golfing clients. They wish to attract clients who are currently playing professionally but do not yet have the skill level or consistency to regularly finish in the top ten of tournaments. They have suggested two primary business requirements:

- **Business Requirement One**
  - The client wishes us to conduct an analysis of current elite-level golf tournament data to determine which golfing skills (e.g., driving, approach play, chipping, and putting) are most likely to result in a player reaching the top ten of a tournament. 
  - They are specifically interested in learning which skill to focus on to help a player improve from a 30thâ€“11th place finish to a top-ten finish.

- **Business Requirement Two**
  - Once they have worked with a player and gained an understanding of their 'strokes gained' performance, they would like us to deliver a machine learning (ML) system capable of reliably predicting the chances of a player finishing in the top ten of a tournament based on their current level of performance.
  - They could also be interested in an ML system that can predict the exact finishing position of a player based on their current level of performance.
